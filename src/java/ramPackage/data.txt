A data hiding is a technique that is used for embedding the important information into images. In reversible data hiding, the degradation of the original image is not allowed, such as medical imagery and military imagery. The secret data is embedded in the compression domain and the receiver wants to store the image in a compression mode to save storage space. An encoding message can be compressed and encrypted by the secrete key. A decode message consists of secret data that can be viewed by the encrypted key. This paper proposed a MSM (Military Secret Message) method which restores the important data. The experimental result shows that proposed system can provide good performance to secure important data.  
With the advent of the World Wide Web and the emergence of ecommerce applications and social networks, organizations across the world generate a large amount of data daily. Information security is the most extreme basic issue in guaranteeing safe transmission of data through the web. Also, network security issues are now becoming important as society is moving towards digital information age. As more and more users connect to the internet it attracts a lot of cyber-attacks. It’s required to protect computer and network security i.e., the critical issues. The pernicious hubs make an issue in the system. It can utilize the assets of different hubs and safeguard the assets of its own. In this paper we provide an overview on Network Security and various techniques through which Network Security can be enhanced i.e. Cryptography.
